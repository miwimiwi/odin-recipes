    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Piragi are bread rolls that are traditionally filled with bacon
        and onions, and which originate from the Baltic state of Latvia.
        They are usually made for special occasions and celebrations,
        and baked in large batches. </p>
    <p>Traditionally, the filling of a pīrāgs (singular of pīrāgi) consists 
        of finely diced bacon and onion, but Latvian families tend to have their 
        own recipe variations that are passed down from generation to generation. 
        Other common fillings include ground beef, ham, chicken and fish. The dough 
        is soft with a hint of butter flavor, so it is a perfect base for a host of fillings.</p>
